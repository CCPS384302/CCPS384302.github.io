<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I Fabian Caceros-Vasquez am working towards becoming a player in the MLB or at college level. I would also like to go to a college with a full ride, and study some form of engineering. I have a passion for baseball so that is why I would like to do that professionally, if that does not happen I would like to follow a career in engineering since I was a little kid I would like to build things and innovate. I am working toward the goal of making it into the MLB by practicing everyday and taking care of my arm. As well as this I am working towards  becoming an engineer by taking engineering courses during High School. I consider the value of hardworking and not procrastinating to be very important in both of these goals. If I work hard then I will be better at baseball, and working hard will allow for people to see work in classes and maybe get an academic scholarship. Not procrastinating will also help with college once I make it to that point. I would like to achieve the goal of averaging a velocity of 69-70 on my pitching this year. I would also like to achieve the goal of getting all A's in all of my classes. I would also like to learn how to throw a good changeup that moves inside for right handed batters. I want to be most noted for being a team player and being hard working. I would like to be known for these traits so that when a coach or employer sees that I am hardworking and a team player they would consider me when choosing a team or employee. </p>
